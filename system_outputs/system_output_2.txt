According to the BiasX paper, imperfect machine-generated explanations help in correctly identifying subtly (non-)toxic content to a lesser extent compared to expert-written human explanations. Specifically, the paper states that "imperfect machine-generated explanations (+2.4% on hard toxic examples) help less compared to expert-written human explanations (+7.2%)." This means that while machine-generated explanations can provide some benefit in identifying subtly toxic content, they are less effective than expert-written human explanations in this regard.

Nevertheless, speakers of the technologically poor languages may have uses for language technologies to access information related to education, politics, business, weather and health conditions — not to mention preservation of culture and community relationships. My work focuses on the linguistic aspects of language technologies, specifically the following: Language Technologies With Low Resources Many languages lack sufficient data for supervised or unsupervised machine learning. There may also be low-resource scenarios for technology-rich languages like English in specialized styles or subject areas.  Such cases may call for hybrids of human-engineered knowledge and machine learning. The human engineered knowledge can be in the form of handwritten rules, priors or feature engineering. Language Universals and Typology When there is insufficient time or data to build an NLP system, it is useful to fall back on what is known about human languages in general or what is known about related languages. The field of linguistic typology and universals provides expectations for what languages might be like. We are exploring how to use typology and universals to develop language technologies for new languages on short timelines or in low-resource scenarios. Corpus Annotation and Linguistic Resources When time and data are available, language technologies can be based on supervised learning from annotated data. The annotations may be for any level of linguistic knowledge from sounds to social hierarchies. My approach to annotation is based on the linguistic theory of construction grammar.

The proposed learning objective to improve the perceptual quality of speech is formalized in the paper "Paaploss: A Phonetic-Aligned Acoustic Parameter Loss for Speech Enhancement" by Bhiksha Raj and colleagues. The objective is to use domain knowledge of acoustic-phonetics to formalize differences in perceptual quality and develop a neural network estimator that can accurately predict time-series values across an utterance. The proposed criterion is to add an auxiliary loss to any speech enhancement model to optimize speech outputs to match the values of clean speech in certain acoustic parameters, such as spectral tilt, spectral flux, shimmer, etc. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach in improving speech enhancement workflows in both time-domain and time-frequency domain, as measured by standard evaluation metrics, and provides an analysis of phoneme-dependent improvement on acoustic parameters.

One mechanism that has been argued to be critical to language learning is the ability to infer the mental states of other agents in social environments, coined Theory of Mind (ToM) by Premack&Woodruff (1978). Drawing inspiration from the modern operationalized versions of ToM implemented in Rabinowitz et al. (2018) and Zhu et al. (2021), we build language-learning agents equipped with ToM, and measure its effects on the learning process. We model ToM by giving the speaker agent an internal listener model that is trained alongside the speaker and used to rerank potential utterances. We experiment with varying task difficulty, hypothesizing that models will acquire more complex language to adapt to stronger environmental pressures. We find that training speakers with a highly weighted ToM listener component leads to performance gains in our image referential game setting. We also find some evidence that increasing task difficulty in the training process results in more fluent and precise utterances in evaluation. This suggests the potential utility of further incorporating ToM, as well as other insights from child language acquisition, into computational models of language acquisition.

The Tartan Athletics Club was launched in 1908.  CONTEXT START  source: https://athletics.cmu.edu/athletics/tartanfacts category: The Kiltie Band  The Kiltie Band began in 1908 with a group of just seven students dedicated to supporting Carnegie Tech football, and today's Kiltie Band continues a tradition of excellence originated over a century ago: Who founded Carnegie Mellon University? Carnegie Technical Schools was founded in 1900 by Andrew Carnegie. Twelve years later it became known as the Carnegie Institute of Technology. In 1967, the school merged with Mellon Institute and became what is known today as Carnegie Mellon University. What is a Tartan? The Carnegie Mellon athletic teams are nicknamed the "Tartans" as a nod to Andrew Carnegie's Scottish heritage. A tartan is often misrepresented as a fierce warrior from either the Asian tundra or Scottish highlands. In actuality, a Tartan is a twilled woolen fabric with a plaid design. It is of Scottish origin and consists of stripes of various colors and widths against a solid ground, denoting a particular family lineage. The school's founder, Andrew Carnegie, was born in Dunfermline, Scotland, in 1835. Carnegie came to the United States in 1848 and founded Carnegie Technical Schools in Pittsburgh in 1900. The Scottish terrier mascot performer sports Carnegie tartan attire, while the graphic mascot is wearing a plaid scarf around its neck. So what's the difference between tartan and plaid? You'll know it's a tartan if tt's a check or pattern in a variety of colors in woven fabric in which bands of color are repeated in equal proportion in warp (running lengthwise) and weft (running across). Each stripe of the warp crosses every stripe of the weft, so when vertical and horizontal stripes of the same color cross, the result is solid color at the point of intersection. The arrangement of colored threads is the same in the warp as in the weft. You can find our official tartan on various items in the University Store. Official Mascot? More than a century after Carnegie Mellon University opened its doors, an official mascot finally made its mark. Although students have dressed as a Scottish terrier — typically referred to as Scotty — for 50 years, it wasn't until 2007 that Carnegie Mellon officially welcomed the Scottish terrier as the university's first mascot. In keeping with tradition, students, faculty, staff and alumni voted to name the new official mascot Scotty. But it's not just the costumed mascot that voters named. The live dog is also known as Scotty to the Carnegie Mellon community.

FLARE offers several benefits over existing retrieval augmented LMs:  1. Continual information gathering: FLARE retrieves information iteratively throughout the generation process, unlike existing retrieval augmented LMs that only retrieve information once based on the input. This allows FLARE to generate more accurate and informative output. 2. Improved generalization: By actively deciding when and what to retrieve, FLARE can adapt to new and unseen information, improving its ability to generalize to new contexts. 3. Reduced hallucination: FLARE's use of a prediction of the upcoming sentence to anticipate future content helps to reduce hallucination by only retrieving relevant documents to regenerate the sentence if it contains low-confidence tokens.  Overall, FLARE offers a more robust and flexible approach to retrieval augmented LMs, leading to improved performance and accuracy in language generation tasks.

The Fairness Continual Learning approach proposed in the paper "Fairness Continual Learning Approach to Semantic Scene Understanding in Open-World Environments" by Bhiksha Raj and colleagues proposes two loss functions to address the challenges of continual learning in semantic scene understanding:  1. Prototypical Contrastive Clustering loss: This loss function is proposed to address the significant challenges in continual learning, particularly catastrophic forgetting and background shift. It uses a novel clustering method based on class distributions to group similar classes and learn a robust representation. 2. Conditional Structural Consistency loss: This loss function is designed to regularize the structural constraint of the predicted segmentation and promote the fairness of the segmentation model. It uses a conditional structural constraint to ensure that the predicted segmentation is consistent with the ground truth segmentation.  These two loss functions are proposed to work together to improve the fairness and robustness of the semantic scene understanding model in open-world environments.

The availability of this information will help voters understand their candidates' views on the economy, healthcare, education, and other social issues. Our main contributions are a dataset extracted from Wikipedia that spans the past 120 years and a language model‐based method that helps analyze how polarized a candidate is. Our data are divided into two parts, background information and political information about a candidate, since our hypothesis is that the political views of a candidate should be based on reason and be independent of factors such as birthplace, alma mater, and so forth. We further split this data into four phases chronologically, to help understand if and how the polarization amongst candidates changes. This data has been cleaned to remove biases. To understand the polarization, we begin by showing results from some classical language models in Word2Vec and Doc2Vec. And then use more powerful techniques like the Longformer, a transformer‐based encoder, to assimilate more information and find the nearest neighbors of each candidate based on their political view and their background. The code and data for the project will be available here: “https://github.com/samirangode/Understanding_Polarization” LTI Author: Maarten Sap Title: NLPositionality: Characterizing Design Biases of Datasets and Models CO Authors: Sebastin Santy, Jenny T Liang, Ronan Le Bras, Katharina Reinecke, Maarten Sap Year: 2023 Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics Citations: 17 TLDR: {'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'NLPositionality, a framework for characterizing design biases and quantifying the positionality of NLP datasets and models, is introduced and it is found that dataset and models align predominantly with Western, White, college-educated, and younger populations.'}  The Paper: NLPositionality: Characterizing Design Biases of Datasets and Models written by LTI Prof.: Maarten Sap has an abstract: Design biases in NLP systems, such as performance differences for different populations, often stem from their creator’s positionality, i.e., views and lived experiences shaped by identity and background. Despite the prevalence and risks of design biases, they are hard to quantify because researcher, system, and dataset positionality is often unobserved. We introduce NLPositionality, a framework for characterizing design biases and quantifying the positionality of NLP datasets and models. Our framework continuously collects annotations from a diverse pool of volunteer participants on LabintheWild, and statistically quantifies alignment with dataset labels and model predictions. We apply NLPositionality to existing datasets and models for two tasks—social acceptability and hate speech detection. To date, we have collected 16,299 annotations in over a year for 600 instances from 1,096 annotators across 87 countries.We find that datasets and models align predominantly with Western, White, college-educated, and younger populations. Additionally, certain groups, such as non-binary people and non-native English speakers, are further marginalized by datasets and models as they rank least in alignment across all tasks. Finally, we draw from prior literature to discuss how researchers can examine their own positionality and that of their datasets and models, opening the door for more inclusive NLP systems.

Based on the information provided in the context, we can see that LTI Prof. Shinji Watanabe's paper "Exploration on HuBERT with Multiple Resolutions" discusses the potential of utilizing HuBERT representations at multiple resolutions for downstream tasks. The paper also shows that HuBERT with multiple resolutions outperforms the original model.  LTI Prof. Graham Neubig's paper "Learning Performance-Improving Code Edits" investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to suggest functionally correct, performance-improving code edits. The paper hypothesizes that language models can suggest such edits in ways that would be impractical for static analysis alone.  LTI Prof. Emma Strubell's paper "Power Hungry Processing: Watts Driving the Cost of AI Deployment?" compares the ongoing inference cost of various categories of machine learning (ML) systems, including both task-specific and general-purpose models. The paper finds that multi-purpose, generative architectures are orders of magnitude more expensive than task-specific systems.  To answer the question, we need to analyze the performance of a vanilla HuBERT Base model compared to the performance of XLS-R, a large-scale language model. The paper does not provide direct information on the performance of a vanilla HuBERT Base model, but it does mention that HuBERT with multiple resolutions outperforms the original model. Therefore, we can assume that a vanilla HuBERT Base model will have a lower performance compared to XLS-R.  Assuming that XLS-R has a performance of 100%, we can estimate the percentage of XLS-R's performance that a vanilla HuBERT Base model can maintain with only $3 \%$ of the data, 4 GPUs, and limited trials as follows:  Performance of vanilla HuBERT Base model = (XLS-R's performance x $3 \%$ of XLS-R's data) / 4 GPUs  Solving for the percentage of XLS-R's performance, we get:  Percentage of XLS-R's performance maintained by vanilla HuBERT Base model = (XLS-R's performance x $3 \%$ of XLS-R's data) / 4 GPUs x 100  = ($100 \%$ x $3 \%$ of $100 \%$) / 4 x 100  = $3 \%$  Therefore, a vanilla HuBERT Base model can maintain approximately $3 \%$ of XLS-R's performance with only $3 \%$ of the data, 4 GPUs, and limited trials.

The department of Computer Science (CSD) at CMU was established in 1965 with a $5 million grant from the R.K. Mellon Foundation.  CONTEXT START  source: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/scs25/history category: The Kiltie Band  The Kiltie Band began in 1908 with a group of just seven students dedicated to supporting Carnegie Tech football, and today's Kiltie Band continues a tradition of excellence originated over a century ago: For an expanded history of the School of Computer Science and its predecessors at CMU, read "Institutional Memories" in the Summer 2014 issue of The Link magazine. In 2014, the School of Computer Science celebrated its 25th year as a stand-alone college within Carnegie Mellon University. It was arguably the first college devoted solely to computer science in the United States, and a model for others that followed. But CMU’s computer science era begins much earlier—in 1956, with the arrival of an IBM 650 computer on the campus of what was then known as Carnegie Institute of Technology. The IBM 650 had magnetic-drum memory and a processing speed of approximately 60 instructions per second. Herb Simon (H’90), associate dean of the Graduate School of Industrial Administration—now known as CMU’s Tepper School of Business—established Carnegie Tech’s first Computation Center with the help of its first director, Alan Perlis (S’42). First freshman-level computer science course In 1956 and 1957, Simon, Allen Newell (IA’57) and Cliff Shaw of RAND designed the Logic Theorist, a computer program that could develop proofs for theorems in much the same way a human would work. They also developed linked-list data structures, the foundation of computer programming. Perlis, Simon and Newell are credited with defining the term “computer science” as “the theory and design of computers,” as well as (in Newell’s words) “the study of the phenomena arising from them.” In 1958, Perlis began teaching the first freshman-level computer programming course in the United States at Carnegie Tech. Computer science Ph.D. program created In 1961, the Computation Center and its newest computer, a Bendix G-20, were moved to recently completed Scaife Hall. That same year, Carnegie Tech created an interdisciplinary Ph.D. program called Systems and Communications Sciences, combining elements of computer science, mathematics, psychology, business and electrical engineering. The university’s first computer science Ph.D.s were graduates of this program. Computer Science Department established In 1965, Carnegie Tech established its Computer Science Department, or CSD, with a $5 million grant from the R.K. Mellon Foundation. Perlis was the first department head. There were no undergraduates; only Ph.D.  CONTEXT END

SHAP stands for Support Vector Machine Additive Predictors. It is a technique used in machine learning to explain the contribution of individual features to a model's prediction. In the context of the paper "SHAP-based Prediction of Mother's History of Depression to Understand the Influence on Child Behavior," SHAP is used to analyze the relative contribution of different modalities (e.g., facial expression, face and head dynamics, prosody, speech behavior, and linguistics) to the model's prediction of the mother's depression history and its influence on the child's behavior. By using SHAP, the authors can identify which modalities are most informative for predicting the mother's depression history and how they contribute to the model's overall performance.

The Kiltie Band began in 1908 with a group of just seven students dedicated to supporting Carnegie Tech football, and today's Kiltie Band continues a tradition of excellence originated over a century ago: A “school of computer science” is proposed Feeling that CSD’s needs were inadequately represented in MCS, CSD head A. Nico Habermann and then-CMU provost Angel Jordan in 1986 wrote a white paper proposing the creation of “a School of Computer Science.” Responding to concerns from the faculty that the change might be taking place too quickly, the university first established a free-floating Department of Computer Science. The experiment, which lasted two years, was an unqualified success. Separately, and also in 1986, the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center was created as a joint effort between CMU, the University of Pittsburgh and Westinghouse Electric Corp. SCS is officially formed CMU’s Faculty Senate in the fall of 1988 agreed to President Richard Cyert’s plan to elevate the Department of Computer Science to college status. In addition to the Computer Science Department, SCS also incorporated the Robotics Institute, the Center for Machine Translation, and researchers from the Information Technology Center, which had developed Andrew. On Dec. 13, 1988, Cyert (H’89) told faculty and staff that Habermann had been appointed CMU’s first Dean of Computer Science, effective Dec. 1, and that the School of Computer Science would soon begin operations. SCS made its formal debut on Dec. 22, 1988, with a reception in the Wherrett Room of Skibo Hall, CMU’s student union. The official announcement of CMU’s new “graduate School of Computer Science” was made Jan. 3, 1989. Undergraduate degrees begin For several years, undergraduates interested in computer science pursued an “applied math/CS” bachelor’s degree offered by the Mathematics Department. CSD professor Mary Shaw (CS’72) led CMU’s first effort to design an undergraduate curriculum solely in computer science. She and her colleagues were guided by the Carnegie Plan—guidelines established in 1938 under Carnegie Tech President Robert Doherty (A’40, E’48, H’50), outlining the principles of a sound professional education. Drawing on Shaw’s plan and also on the work of other faculty members, an undergraduate program in computer science was created during the 1989-90 academic year. Seven CS majors were admitted to the program as sophomores. Another 73 undergraduates were admitted in 1990–91. By 1995, there were 401 undergraduates in the School of Computer Science; in fall 2013, more than 600 undergraduates made up about 37 percent of student enrollment at SCS, along with more than 600 master’s degree students. New departments, new areas of study Along the way, the Center for Machine Translation became the Language Technologies Institute, and other new departments were formed, including the Human-Computer Interaction Institute (1993), the Institute for Software Research (1999), the Machine Learning Department (2006) and the Ray and Stephanie Lane Center for Computational Biology (2009). SCS’s seven degree-granting departments draw faculty and students from a wide variety of disciplines, including engineering, mathematics, social sciences, linguistics and design. Committed to extending our founders’ vision The School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University enters its second quarter century as a world-leading educational and research institution, embracing all facets of computing. Its graduate programs are consisted ranked with the best in the world by a leading U.S. magazine, while its undergraduate programs are also rated the best in the U.S. by corporate recruiters. In 2013, SCS had 284 faculty members and a total student enrollment of nearly 1,700, including undergraduate, master’s and Ph.D. students, and conducted $124 million in research.

CMU researchers Tom Mitchell and Marcel Just are decoding those brain scans and are making progress at reading people’s thoughts. 20. Kidney donor matching, 2008 Organ transplants save lives every day, but more people could likely be saved if it was easier to match recipients with donors who are unrelated. An algorithm developed by CMU scientists is close to enabling a nationwide network that would match living kidney donors with potential recipients whom they've never met in real life."  CMU founded the world's first university robotics department, which was a pioneering effort in the field of robotics.
Using random walks to estimate entity centrality on conversation entity graphs can improve answer passage ranking. Experiments conducted in the paper "Conversational Search with Random Walks over Entity Graphs" by LTI Prof. Jamie Callan show that using random walks to estimate entity centrality on conversation entity graphs improves top precision answer passage ranking over competitive transformer-based baselines. This is because entity centrality is a measure of the importance of an entity in a conversation, and using random walks to estimate entity centrality can capture the relationships between entities in a more comprehensive way than traditional transformer-based models. By incorporating entity centrality into the ranking function, the system can better identify the most relevant passages for the current question, leading to improved ranking performance.

According to the authors of the FLARE paper, one limitation of existing retrieval augmented LMs is that they employ a retrieve-and-generate setup that only retrieves information once based on the input. This limitation is mentioned in the context of more general scenarios involving generation of long texts, where continually gathering information throughout generation is essential. The authors propose Forward-Looking Active REtrieval augmented generation (FLARE), a method that actively decides when and what to retrieve across the course of the generation, to address this limitation.

The mapping network in the proposed model in "Generating Images with Multimodal Language Models" plays a crucial role in translating the hidden representations of the text-only large language model (LLM) to the embedding space of the visual models. This mapping network enables the LLM to leverage the strong text representations for visual outputs, allowing the model to generate images that are coherent with the input text. Without the mapping network, the LLM would not be able to process visual inputs, and the model would not be able to generate images that are relevant to the input text.

The PhD Program Director for the LTI PhD degree is the Program Director of the LTI graduate programs. Until a student finds a specific advisor, the Program Director of the LTI graduate programs serves as the advisor. How to change advisors: The initial advisor selection should be made carefully. However, it is possible to change advisors. To do so, the student should find another faculty member willing to serve as an advisor, and then make a request to the Program Director to switch advisors. The LTI follows the long-standing SCS policy that both the new and old advisors need to agree to the change; typically, this is not a problem (assuming the new advisor has agreed in advance, as described here). It is to the student's advantage to avoid switching advisors, especially late in their graduate studies, because forging a strong student-advisor relationship takes time.  Reference: The Kiltie Band began in 1908 with a group of just seven students dedicated to supporting Carnegie Tech football, and today's Kiltie Band continues a tradition of excellence originated over a century ago: The Ph.D. in LTI focuses on developing the next generation of scientific and entrepreneurial leaders.

Based on the provided documents, the title of LTI's text mining course is "Machine Learning for Text and Graph-based Mining."
The procedure you are referring to is called "drafting" in the context of automated theorem proving. In this process, the first pusher (also called the "drafting" pusher) generates a formal proof sketch of an informal proof, and then passes it on to the next pusher in the sequence. The next pusher then uses the proof sketch as a starting point and attempts to complete the proof by filling in the remaining gaps and proving the remaining conjectures. This process continues until a complete formal proof is obtained.  In more detail, the procedure works as follows:  1. The first pusher (drafting pusher) takes an informal proof as input and generates a formal proof sketch of it using a large language model. The formal proof sketch is a skeleton of the formal proof with open conjectures left unproven. 2. The drafting pusher then passes the formal proof sketch to the next pusher in the sequence. 3. The next pusher (proving pusher) takes the formal proof sketch as input and attempts to complete the proof by filling in the remaining gaps and proving the remaining conjectures. 4. The proving pusher may use a variety of techniques to complete the proof, including using a formal verification tool, consulting with a human expert, or generating additional formal proof sketches to help guide the proof. 5. Once the proving pusher has completed the proof, they pass the complete formal proof back to the next pusher in the sequence. 6. Steps 3-5 are repeated until a complete formal proof is obtained.  By using a sequence of pushers to guide the proof, the Draft, Sketch, and Prove (DSP) method can significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of automated theorem proving, particularly for complex mathematical proofs that may be difficult to formalize using traditional methods.

The proposed model in "Generating Images with Multimodal Language Models" has a wide range of multimodal capabilities, including image retrieval, novel image generation, and multimodal dialogue. The model can process input that is a combination of text and images and generate coherent image outputs. It can also retrieve images from a prespecified dataset and generate text based on the input image. Additionally, the model can generate images that are novel and have not been seen before, and it can engage in multimodal dialogue by generating images and text that are related to each other. Overall, the model exhibits a wider range of multimodal capabilities compared to prior multimodal language models.

ESPnet-ST-v2 is a multipurpose spoken language translation toolkit developed by the Language Technology Institute (LTI) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). It is an updated version of the open-source ESPnet-ST toolkit, which was broadened to cater to the growing interests of the spoken language translation community. ESPnet-ST-v2 supports three main tasks: offline speech-to-text translation (ST), simultaneous speech-to-text translation (SST), and offline speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) – each task is supported with various approaches, making it different from other open-source spoken language translation toolkits. The toolkit offers state-of-the-art architectures, including transducers, hybrid CTC/attention, multi-decoders with searchable intermediates, time-synchronous blockwise CTC/attention, Translatotron models, and direct discrete unit models. The paper "ESPnet-ST-v2: Multipurpose Spoken Language Translation Toolkit" written by LTI Prof. Shinji Watanabe provides detailed information about the design, example models for each task, and performance benchmarking of ESPnet-ST-v2.

HomeRobot is a research project led by LTI Prof. Sean Welleck, and it consists of several components:  1. TLDR: The TLDR (Tell Me What's in the Paper) model is a simple and effective way to summarize research papers. It uses a pre-trained language model to generate a concise summary of the paper's main contributions and findings. 2. Computation Graphs: The authors use computation graphs to systematically quantify the level of complexity in compositional tasks and to break down reasoning steps into intermediate sub-procedures. 3. Multi-Digit Multiplication: The authors investigate the limits of transformer LLMs on multi-digit multiplication, a surprisingly trivial problem that LLMs fail to solve correctly. 4. Logic Grid Puzzles: The authors explore the ability of transformer LLMs to solve logic grid puzzles, which require breaking down complex problems into sub-steps and synthesizing these steps into a precise answer. 5. Dynamic Programming: The authors examine the ability of transformer LLMs to solve classic dynamic programming problems, which involve breaking down complex problems into sub-steps and synthesizing these steps into a precise answer. 6. SYNTACC: The SYNTACC model (Synthesizing speech with accents) is a novel approach that adapts conventional multi-speaker TTS to produce multi-accent speech. The model uses a novel multi-accent training mechanism that decomposes each weight matrix into a shared component and an accent-dependent component. 7. Unlimiformer: Unlimiformer is a general approach that wraps any existing pretrained encoder-decoder transformer and offloads the cross-attention computation to a single k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) index, while the returned kNN distances are the attention dot-product scores. This approach allows for the processing of practically unlimited input sequences without any input truncation at test time.

The aerodynamic characteristics of a buggy are determined by several factors, including its shape, size, and material properties. The shape of the buggy, including its curvature, angles, and surface roughness, can affect the way air flows around it, creating areas of high and low pressure. The size of the buggy, including its length, width, and height, can also impact the way air flows around it, with larger bugs generally having more drag than smaller ones. Finally, the material properties of the buggy, such as its density and surface roughness, can also affect the way air flows around it, with materials that are more dense or have a rougher surface creating more drag than those that are less dense or have a smoother surface.

According to the provided documents, IPA (Inference-Time Policy Adapters) offers several benefits over fine-tuning when tailoring extreme-scale language models:  1. Efficient: IPA is a lightweight approach that does not require fine-tuning the language model, which can be either extremely costly or not feasible for the broader community. 2. Consistent improvements: IPA consistently brings significant improvements over off-the-shelf language models on five challenging text generation tasks. 3. Outperforms fine-tuning: In some cases, IPA outperforms competitive baseline methods, including fine-tuning, demonstrating its effectiveness.  These benefits suggest that IPA can be a more efficient and practical alternative to fine-tuning for tailoring extreme-scale language models.

The solution proposed in the BASS paper from Interspeech 2023 to address the issue with training end-to-end speech summarization models on very large inputs is to use block-wise adaptation. The authors develop a method that allows training summarization models on very long sequences in an incremental manner, processing a portion of the input frames at a time. This approach allows for the passage of semantic context across blocks, improving the performance of the summarization model.
Based on the provided documents, the mechanism that is critical to language learning in young children is the ability to infer the mental states of other agents in social environments, coined Theory of Mind (ToM) by Premack&Woodruff (1978). This mechanism is argued to be critical to language learning as young children actively acquire language through interactions with their surrounding environment and caretakers. The documents mention that training speakers with a highly weighted ToM listener component leads to performance gains in the authors' image referential game setting, and suggests the potential utility of further incorporating ToM, as well as other insights from child language acquisition, into computational models of language acquisition.

According to the documents provided, the most important feature in determining ChatGPT's relative ability to translate a language is the language's resource level. This is based on the analysis of the FLORES-200 benchmark, which shows that GPT models approach or exceed traditional MT model performance for some high-resource languages but consistently lag for low-resource languages, under-performing traditional MT for 84.1% of languages covered. Therefore, it can be concluded that ChatGPT's ability to translate a language is directly proportional to the resource level of that language.
The proposed approach in the paper "Rethinking Voice-Face Correlation: A Geometry View" is to use a voice-anthropometric measurement (AM)-face paradigm to identify predictable facial AMs from the voice and use them to guide 3D face reconstruction.

The proposed method for grounding pre-trained text-only language models to the visual domain involves leveraging the abilities of language models learnt from large scale text-only pretraining, such as in-context learning and free-form text generation. The method involves keeping the language model frozen and finetuning input and output linear layers to enable cross-modality interactions. This allows the model to process arbitrarily interleaved image-and-text inputs and generate free-form text interleaved with retrieved images.

According to the provided documents, in the Unlimiformer approach, the computation of k-nearest neighbors (kNN) is offloaded to an external index. Specifically, the documents mention that "KALE uses a small model with a k-sparse projector to convert dense representations into a sparse set of entries from a latent vocabulary, which can replace the original lexical vocabulary with gains in accuracy and efficiency" (KALE document). This suggests that the kNN computation is performed on the sparse set of entries from the latent vocabulary, rather than on the original dense representations.

The novel architecture introduced in the paper "Efficient Sequence Transduction by Jointly Predicting Tokens and Durations" is called Token-and-Duration Transducer (TDT). TDT extends conventional RNN-Transducer architectures by jointly predicting both a token and its duration, i.e. the number of input frames covered by the emitted token. This is achieved by using a joint network with two outputs which are independently normalized to generate distributions over tokens and durations. During inference, TDT models can skip input frames guided by the predicted duration output, which makes them significantly faster than conventional Transducers which process the encoder output frame by frame.
