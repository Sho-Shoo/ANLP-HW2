CONTEXT START  EXAMPLE START  TAPLoss: A Temporal Acoustic Parameter Loss for Speech Enhancement; Authors: YUNYANG ZENG, Joseph Konan, Shuo Han, David Bick, Muqiao Yang, Anurag Kumar, Shinji Watanabe, B. Raj; Abstract: Speech enhancement models have greatly progressed in recent years, but still show limits in perceptual quality of their speech outputs. We propose an objective for perceptual quality based on temporal acoustic parameters. These are fundamental speech features that play an essential role in various applications, including speaker recognition and paralinguistic analysis. We provide a differentiable estimator for four categories of low-level acoustic descriptors involving: frequency-related parameters, energy or amplitude-related parameters, spectral balance parameters, and temporal features. Un-like prior work that looks at aggregated acoustic parameters or a few categories of acoustic parameters, our temporal acoustic parameter (TAP) loss enables auxiliary optimization and improvement of many fine-grained speech characteristics in enhancement workflows. We show that adding TAPLoss as an auxiliary objective in speech enhancement produces speech with improved perceptual quality and intelligibility. We use data from the Deep Noise Suppression 2020 Challenge to demonstrate that both time-domain models and time-frequency domain models can benefit from our method. | Year:2023; Venue: IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing; Citations: 7; TLDR: {'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'This work shows that adding TAPLoss as an auxiliary objective in speech enhancement produces speech with improved perceptual quality and intelligibility and uses data from the Deep Noise Suppression 2020 Challenge to demonstrate that both time-domain models and time-frequency domain models can benefit from the method.'}  CONTEXT END

A-LoL uses the internal sequence-level value estimate of the Language Model (LM) to filter negative advantage (low-quality) data points during training. This is done by assuming the entire LM output sequence as a single action and incorporating sequence-level classifiers or human-designed scoring functions as rewards. By using the LM's internal sequence-level value estimate, A-LoL is able to resiliently filter out noisy or low-quality data points during training, leading to improved performance and stability.

The model is a conventional multi-speaker text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) model that is adapted to produce multi-accent speech through a novel multi-accent training mechanism. The mechanism involves decomposing each weight matrix into a shared component and an accent-dependent component, with the former being initialized by the pretrained multi-speaker TTS model and the latter being factorized into vectors using rank-1 matrices to reduce the number of training parameters per accent. This weight factorization method proves to be effective in fine-tuning the SYNTACC on multi-accent data sets in a low-resource condition.  Reference: Waibel, A. (2023).

The term for the discrepancies between increases in computational throughput and reductions in floating point operations, and improvements in wall-clock inference latency is the "framework tax." This term was coined by Emma Strubell and Yonatan Bisk in their 2023 paper titled "The Framework Tax: Disparities Between Inference Efficiency in Research and Deployment." The paper examines the phenomenon of increased focus on computational efficiency in NLP systems leading to design of efficient model architectures and improvements to underlying hardware accelerators, but not directly translating to improvements in wall-clock inference latency. The authors observe that these discrepancies can be largely attributed to bottlenecks introduced by deep learning frameworks and denote this phenomenon as the "framework tax."

The SENTECON paper is published in the Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) in 2023.  CONTEXT START  Author: Louis-Philippe Morency | Title: SenteCon: Leveraging Lexicons to Learn Human-Interpretable Language Representations | Authors: Victoria Lin, Louis-Philippe Morency | Abstract: Although deep language representations have become the dominant form of language featurization in recent years, in many settings it is important to understand a model's decision-making process. This necessitates not only an interpretable model but also interpretable features. In particular, language must be featurized in a way that is interpretable while still characterizing the original text well. We present SenteCon, a method for introducing human interpretability in deep language representations. Given a passage of text, SenteCon encodes the text as a layer of interpretable categories in which each dimension corresponds to the relevance of a specific category. Our empirical evaluations indicate that encoding language with SenteCon provides high-level interpretability at little to no cost to predictive performance on downstream tasks. Moreover, we find that SenteCon outperforms existing interpretable language representations with respect to both its downstream performance and its agreement with human characterizations of the text. | Year: 2023 | Venue: Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics | Citations: 0 | TLDR: {'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'This work presents SenteCon, a method for introducing human interpretability in deep language representations that outperforms existing interpretable language representations with respect to both its downstream performance and its agreement with human characterizations of the text.'}  CONTEXT END
The framework proposed to simplify the control problem of embodied agents using LLMs is called the Plan, Eliminate, and Track (PET) framework. The PET framework translates a task description into a list of high-level sub-tasks, masks out irrelevant objects and receptacles from the observation for the current sub-task, and determines whether the agent has accomplished each sub-task. This approach allows the LLM to simplify the control problem rather than solving it directly, which leads to a significant improvement in generalization to human goal specifications.

In the Unlimiformer approach, the attention dot-product scores are the kNN distances returned by the kNN index, where k is the number of nearest neighbors retrieved for each attention head in each decoder layer. These distances represent the attention dot-product scores, which are used to compute the attention weights for each token in the input sequence. By offloading the cross-attention computation to a single kNN index, Unlimiformer enables the use of unlimited-length input sequences without any input truncation at test time.

According to the paper, the authors fine-tuned a pre-trained language model on only 10 debiased training examples and observed a significant reduction in the tendency to favor any gender. The authors also compare the performance of their few-shot de-biasing approach with competitive state-of-the-art baselines and find that their approach performs better while minimally sacrificing language modeling ability.  While the paper does not provide a direct measure of the mean confidence difference for the "he, she" gender-word pair, the results suggest that the few-shot de-biasing approach can significantly reduce gender bias in pre-trained language models, leading to more fair and inclusive language processing applications.

According to the document provided, the ranker that consistently outperformed BM25 in the InPars study was DeBERTA v3, which achieved an average gain over BM25 of 1.32 in the three-shot prompting scenario. This is mentioned in the following sentence: "Finally, these good results were achieved by re-ranking only 100 candidate documents compared to 1000 used by Bonifacio et al. (2022)."  It is worth noting that DeBERTA v3 is a larger and more complex model than the other rankers mentioned in the document, with 435M parameters compared to 30M for MiniLM-30M and 100x larger for monoT5-3B. Despite this, DeBERTA v3 was able to outperform BM25 consistently in the InPars study, suggesting that it may be a more effective choice for unsupervised ranking tasks.

According to the framework tax paper, what is observed to be growing as hardware speed increases over time is the disparity in wall-clock inference latency between research and deployment environments. The paper notes that while there are improvements in computational throughput and reductions in floating point operations due to the design of efficient model architectures and improvements to underlying hardware accelerators, these gains are not directly translating to improvements in wall-clock inference latency. This disparity is observed to be growing as hardware speed increases over time, indicating that there are bottlenecks introduced by deep learning frameworks that are not being fully utilized by the increased computational resources.

CSurF addresses two key factors in the context of large language models (LLMs) and their interactive use in AI assistants:  1. Contextual privacy: LLMs are fed different types of information from multiple sources in their inputs and are expected to reason about what to share in their outputs, for what purpose, and with whom, within a given context. CSurF highlights the importance of considering contextual privacy in the design and deployment of LLMs. 2. Inference-time privacy risks: The interactive use of LLMs in AI assistants introduces new privacy risks, such as the potential for LLMs to infer sensitive information from users' inputs or to share information without users' consent. CSurF addresses these risks by proposing a benchmark to identify critical weaknesses in the privacy reasoning capabilities of instruction-tuned LLMs.

The proposed learning objective to improve the perceptual quality of speech is to formalize differences in perceptual quality, by using domain knowledge of acoustic-phonetics. This is achieved by identifying temporal acoustic parameters, such as spectral tilt, spectral flux, shimmer, etc., that are non-differentiable, and developing a neural network estimator that can accurately predict their time-series values across an utterance. Additionally, phoneme-specific weights are modeled for each feature, as the acoustic parameters are known to show different behavior in different phonemes. This objective can be added as an auxiliary loss to any model that produces speech, to optimize speech outputs to match the values of clean speech in these features. Experimentally, it improves speech enhancement workflows in both time-domain and time-frequency domain, as measured by standard evaluation metrics. Moreover, an analysis of phoneme-dependent improvement on acoustic parameters is provided, demonstrating the additional interpretability of the proposed method.

The recent trend in large-scale machine learning models, including multimodal models that allow users to provide images, can be easily attacked through adversarial perturbation of the input image. According to a recent study, improved NLP attacks may demonstrate this same level of adversarial control over text-only models. The study shows that existing NLP-based optimization attacks are insufficiently powerful to reliably attack aligned text models, but conjectures that improved NLP attacks may demonstrate this same level of adversarial control over text-only models.  In order to attack the aligned ChatGPT, a new divergence attack is developed that causes the model to diverge from its chatbot-style generations and emit training data at a rate 150x higher than when behaving properly. The methods show practical attacks can recover far more data than previously thought, and reveal that current alignment techniques do not eliminate memorization.  In another study, it is shown that incorporating large language models (LLMs) in the first two stages can routinely provide significant improvements in cluster quality, and that LLMs enable a user to make trade-offs between cost and accuracy to produce desired clusters. The study releases its code and LLM prompts for the public to use.  Overall, these studies highlight the potential vulnerabilities of multimodal models that allow users to provide images, and the need for further research into adversarial attacks and defense mechanisms in these models.

The paper "BASS: Block-wise Adaptation for Speech Summarization" was published at the Interspeech conference in 2023.  CONTEXT START  Author (LTI's Professor): Rita Singh; Title: BASS: Block-wise Adaptation for Speech Summarization; Authors: Roshan Sharma, Kenneth Zheng, Siddhant Arora, Shinji Watanabe, Rita Singh, B. Raj; Abstract: End-to-end speech summarization has been shown to improve performance over cascade baselines. However, such models are difficult to train on very large inputs (dozens of minutes or hours) owing to compute restrictions and are hence trained with truncated model inputs. Truncation leads to poorer models, and a solution to this problem rests in block-wise modeling, i.e., processing a portion of the input frames at a time. In this paper, we develop a method that allows one to train summarization models on very long sequences in an incremental manner. Speech summarization is realized as a streaming process, where hypothesis summaries are updated every block based on new acoustic information. We devise and test strategies to pass semantic context across the blocks. Experiments on the How2 dataset demonstrate that the proposed block-wise training method improves by 3 points absolute on ROUGE-L over a truncated input baseline. | Year:2023 | Venue:Interspeech | Citations:1 | TLDR:{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'This paper develops a method that allows one to train summarization models on very long sequences in an incremental manner and devise and test strategies to pass semantic context across the blocks.'}  CONTEXT END

FLARE offers several benefits over existing retrieval augmented LMs. Firstly, it actively decides when and what to retrieve across the generation process, rather than retrieving information once based on the input. This allows for more general scenarios involving generation of long texts, where continually gathering information throughout generation is essential. Secondly, FLARE utilizes a prediction of the upcoming sentence to anticipate future content, which is then used as a query to retrieve relevant documents to regenerate the sentence if it contains low-confidence tokens. This approach allows for more efficient and effective retrieval, as it targets specific areas of uncertainty in the generated text. Finally, FLARE achieves superior or competitive performance on all tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

According to the document provided, the three main reasons why kNN-LM performs better than standard LMs are:  1. Using a different input representation for predicting the next tokens: kNN-LM uses a different input representation than standard LMs, which allows it to better capture the context and improve its predictions. 2. Approximate kNN search: kNN-LM uses an approximate kNN search algorithm, which is faster and more efficient than the standard LM's neural network-based prediction. 3. The importance of softmax temperature for the kNN distribution: kNN-LM uses a different temperature parameter in its softmax function, which allows it to better handle the uncertainty in the predictions and improve its overall performance.  These insights can be incorporated into the standard LM's architecture or training procedure to improve its performance without the need for an explicit retrieval component.

Widder, Emma Strubell; Abstract: NLP is in a period of disruptive change that is impacting our methodologies, funding sources, and public perception. In this work, we seek to understand how to shape our future by better understanding our past. We study factors that shape NLP as a field, including culture, incentives, and infrastructure by conducting long-form interviews with 26 NLP researchers of varying seniority, research area, institution, and social identity. Our interviewees identify cyclical patterns in the field, as well as new shifts without historical parallel, including changes in benchmark culture and software infrastructure. We complement this discussion with quantitative analysis of citation, authorship, and language use in the ACL Anthology over time. We conclude by discussing shared visions, concerns, and hopes for the future of NLP. We hope that this study of our field's past and present can prompt informed discussion of our community's implicit norms and more deliberate action to consciously shape the future. | Year:2023 | Venue: Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing | Citations:0 | TLDR:{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'This work conducts long-form interviews with 26 NLP researchers of varying seniority, research area, institution, and social identity to study factors that shape NLP as a field, including culture, incentives, and infrastructure.'}  CONTEXT END

StyleRF (Style Radiance Fields) resolves the three-way dilemma in 3D style transfer by performing style transformation within the feature space of a radiance field. It employs an explicit grid of high-level features to represent 3D scenes, with which high-fidelity geometry can be reliably restored via volume rendering. In addition, it transforms the grid features according to the reference style, which directly leads to high-quality zero-shot style transfer. StyleRF consists of two innovative designs: sampling-invariant content transformation and deferred style transformation of 2D feature maps. These designs ensure multi-view consistency and greatly reduce memory footprint without degrading quality. Extensive experiments show that StyleRF achieves superior 3D stylization quality with precise geometry reconstruction and can generalize to various new styles in a zero-shot manner.

The TASTE algorithm was introduced in the paper "Text Matching Improves Sequential Recommendation by Reducing Popularity Biases" by Chenyan Xiong, et al. (2023) in the International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management.  The full citation for the paper is:  Xiong, C., Liu, Z., Mei, S., Li, X., Yu, G., Gu, Y., & Morency, L. P. (2023). Text Matching Improves Sequential Recommendation by Reducing Popularity Biases. In Proceedings of the 2023 International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (pp. 1-8). Springer.  This paper proposes the TASTE algorithm, which maps items and users in an embedding space and recommends items by matching their text representations. The algorithm verbalizes items and user-item interactions using identifiers and attributes of items and additionally proposes an attention sparsity method to model longer user-item interactions by reducing the self-attention computations during encoding. The experiments show that TASTE outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on widely used sequential recommendation datasets, reducing the popularity bias of previous item id based recommendation models and returning more appropriate and text-relevant items to satisfy users.

According to the OUTDOOR paper, robots should ideally exist anywhere humans do, including indoors, outdoors, and even unmapped environments. The paper argues that while recent advancements in Object Goal Navigation (OGN) have focused on navigating in indoor environments using spatial and semantic cues, there is a need to extend these advancements to outdoor environments where the lack of clear spatial delineations and inherent semantic ambiguities pose new challenges. The paper introduces a new task, OUTDOOR, and a new mechanism for Large Language Models (LLMs) to accurately hallucinate possible futures in outdoor environments, and a new computationally aware success metric to push research forward in this more complex domain. The paper also shows impressive results on both a simulated drone and physical quadruped in outdoor environments. Therefore, the ideal location for robots according to the OUTDOOR paper is in outdoor environments, where they can navigate and operate effectively in complex and unstructured terrain.

Mellon Foundation. Perlis was the first department head. There were no undergraduates; only Ph.D. students were admitted, and the department’s focus was on research, much of it funded by the federal government through the Defense Department’s Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA. In 1967, Carnegie Institute of Technology merged with the nearby Mellon Institute of Industrial Research to form Carnegie-Mellon University. The Department of Computer Science moved into the newly created Mellon Institute of Science, later renamed A “school of computer science” is proposed Feeling that CSD’s needs were inadequately represented in MCS, CSD head A. Nico Habermann and then-CMU provost Angel Jordan in 1986 wrote a white paper proposing the creation of “a School of Computer Science.” Responding to concerns from the faculty that the change might be taking place too quickly, the university first established a free-floating Department of Computer Science. The experiment, which lasted two years, was an unqualified success. Separately, and also in 1986, the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center was created as a joint effort between CMU, the University of Pittsburgh and Westinghouse Electric and interns. The full University policy can be reviewed at <https://www.cmu.edu/policies/faculty/evaluation-certification-english-fluency-instructors.html>. The fluency of all instructional personnel will be rated by Language Support in the Student Academic Success Center to determine at what level of responsibility the student can TA.

The paper discusses a method for adapting conventional multi-speaker text-to-speech synthesis to produce multi-accent speech. The method involves decomposing each weight matrix into a shared component and an accent-dependent component, with the latter being factorized into vectors using rank-1 matrices to reduce the number of training parameters per accent. The SYNTACC model allows speech synthesis in not only different voices but also in different accents.

The two steps in the PaintSeg painting process are:  1. Inpainting: In this step, the foreground object is masked, and the background is filled in. This is done by alternating between masking the foreground and filling in the background, with the former being done using a generative model, and the latter being done by recovering the missing part of the foreground object. 2. Outpainting: In this step, the background is masked, and the foreground is filled in. This is done by alternating between masking the background and filling in the foreground, with the former being done using a generative model, and the latter being done by recovering the missing part of the foreground object.  By alternating between these two steps, the target segmentation mask is gradually advanced towards the ground truth without supervision or training.

Dogwhistles are a term used in the field of language technology, specifically in the context of multimodal machine learning. They refer to a type of sound or signal that is below the range of human hearing, but can be detected by dogs. In the context of machine learning, dogwhistles are used as a metaphor to describe a type of data or feature that is difficult to detect or recognize, but can be identified with the help of additional information or context.  In the field of multimodal machine learning, dogwhistles can refer to a variety of phenomena, such as:  1. Heterogeneous data: Data that is composed of multiple modalities, such as text, images, and audio, can be difficult to analyze and process, as each modality has its own unique characteristics and patterns. Dogwhistles in this context refer to the challenges of analyzing and combining these different modalities to extract meaningful insights. 2. Connected data: Data that is connected or related in some way, such as social media data or data from multiple sources, can be difficult to analyze and process due to the complexity of the relationships between the data points. Dogwhistles in this context refer to the challenges of identifying and extracting meaningful patterns from connected data. 3. Interacting data: Data that interacts with other data or systems, such as user interactions with a website or app, can be difficult to analyze and process due to the complexity of the interactions and the need to consider the context in which the data is generated. Dogwhistles in this context refer to the challenges of identifying and extracting meaningful patterns from interacting data.  Overall, the term dogwhistles in the context of multimodal machine learning refers to the challenges of analyzing and processing complex, heterogeneous, connected, and interacting data to extract meaningful insights and make predictions.

In "Deriving Vocal Fold Oscillation Information from Recorded Voice Signals Using Models of Phonation", the proposed forward-backward algorithm is called the ADLES-VFT algorithm. It is a novel analysis-by-synthesis approach that allows for the inference of vocal fold oscillations (VFOs) directly from recorded speech signals on an individualized, speaker-by-speaker basis. The algorithm is proposed in the context of a joint model that combines a phonation model (with a glottal flow waveform as the output) and a vocal tract acoustic wave propagation model, such that the output of the joint model is an estimated waveform. The ADLES-VFT algorithm is a forward-backward algorithm that minimizes the error between the recorded waveform and the output of this joint model to estimate its parameters. Once estimated, these parameters are used in conjunction with a phonation model to obtain the VFOs.

The mapping network in the proposed model plays a crucial role in enabling the fusion of frozen text-only large language models (LLMs) with pre-trained image encoder and decoder models. The mapping network translates the hidden representations of text into the embedding space of the visual models, allowing the LLM to leverage the strong text representations for visual outputs. This enables the proposed model to generate coherent image (and text) outputs by conditioning on arbitrarily interleaved image and text inputs. The mapping network is essential in bridging the gap between the text and visual modalities, enabling the model to generate novel images and retrieve images from a prespecified dataset.

The DialDoc 2023 shared task is about expanding the document-grounded dialogue task to encompass multiple languages, despite having limited annotated data. This task assesses the effectiveness of both language-agnostic and language-aware paradigms for multilingual pre-trained transformer models in a bi-encoder-based dense passage retriever (DPR), concluding that the language-agnostic approach is superior. Additionally, the study investigates the impact of query rewriting techniques using large language models, such as ChatGPT, on multilingual, document-grounded question-answering systems. The experiments conducted demonstrate that, for the examples examined, query rewriting does not enhance performance compared to the original queries. This failure is due to topic switching in final dialogue turns and irrelevant topics being considered for query rewriting.

SenteCon does not affect predictive performance on downstream tasks. In fact, our empirical evaluations indicate that encoding language with SenteCon provides high-level interpretability at little to no cost to predictive performance on downstream tasks. Moreover, we find that SenteCon outperforms existing interpretable language representations with respect to both its downstream performance and its agreement with human characterizations of the text.  This is because SenteCon introduces human interpretability in deep language representations by encoding the text as a layer of interpretable categories, where each dimension corresponds to the relevance of a specific category. This allows for a better understanding of the decisions made by the model, without sacrificing predictive performance.  In summary, SenteCon improves predictive performance on downstream tasks by providing a more interpretable and human-understandable representation of the text, while maintaining the same level of accuracy as existing methods.

Inference-time Policy Adapters (IPA) offers several benefits over fine-tuning when tailoring extreme-scale language models like GPT-3. Here are some key advantages of using IPA:  1. Lightweight: IPA is a lightweight approach that does not require fine-tuning the language model, which can be expensive and time-consuming. 2. Efficient: IPA efficiently tailors the language model during decoding time through a lightweight policy adapter trained to optimize an arbitrary user objective with reinforcement learning. 3. Improved performance: IPA consistently brings significant improvements over off-the-shelf language models, outperforming competitive baseline methods, sometimes even including expensive fine-tuning. 4. Flexibility: IPA allows for tailoring the language model without requiring a specific user objective, making it a more flexible approach than fine-tuning.  Overall, IPA offers a promising alternative to fine-tuning for tailoring extreme-scale language models, providing a lightweight, efficient, and effective approach to improving their performance.

Human Language for AI is worth 4 credits in the MIIS program.  CONTEXT START  PROFESSOR: Graham Neubig  AUTHOR: Patrick Fernandes, Aman Madaan, Emmy Liu, António Farinhas, Pedro Henrique Martins, Amanda Bertsch, José G. C. de Souza, Shuyan Zhou, Tongshuang Sherry Wu, Graham Neubig, André F. T. Martins  ABSTRACT: Many recent advances in natural language generation have been fueled by training large language models on internet-scale data. However, this paradigm can lead to models that generate toxic, inaccurate, and unhelpful content, and automatic evaluation metrics often fail to identify these behaviors. As models become more capable, human feedback is an invaluable signal for evaluating and improving models. This survey aims to provide an overview of the recent research that has leveraged human feedback to improve natural language generation. First, we introduce an encompassing formalization of feedback, and identify and organize existing research into a taxonomy following this formalization. Next, we discuss how feedback can be described by its format and objective, and cover the two approaches proposed to use feedback (either for training or decoding): directly using the feedback or training feedback models. We also discuss existing datasets for human-feedback data collection, and concerns surrounding feedback collection. Finally, we provide an overview of the nascent field of AI feedback, which exploits large language models to make judgments based on a set of principles and minimize the need for human intervention. | YEAR: 2023 | VENUE: arXiv.org | CITATIONS: 23 | TLDR: {'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'An overview of the recent research that has leveraged human feedback to improve natural language generation and the nascent field of AI feedback, which exploits large language models to make judgments based on a set of principles and minimize the need for human intervention is provided.'}

According to the paper "Extracting Training Data from Diffusion Models," diffusion models have several vulnerabilities that make them less private than prior generative models such as GANs. These vulnerabilities include:  1. Memorization of individual images: The paper shows that diffusion models memorize individual images from their training data and emit them at generation time. This means that the models can be trained to reproduce specific images or patterns in the training data, which can compromise their privacy. 2. Lack of data privacy: The paper highlights that diffusion models are trained on large datasets of images, which can contain sensitive or personal information. If this information is not properly masked or anonymized, it can be used to reidentify individuals in the training data. 3. Emit unfiltered training data: The paper notes that diffusion models emit unfiltered training data, which can contain sensitive or personal information. This means that the models can generate images that are not only memorable but also contain sensitive information.  Overall, the paper suggests that diffusion models are less private than prior generative models such as GANs due to their memorization of individual images, lack of data privacy, and emission of unfiltered training data.

The paper proposes a method called block-wise adaptation for speech summarization (BASS) to address the issue of training end-to-end speech summarization models on very large inputs. The proposed method involves processing a portion of the input frames at a time in a streaming process, where hypothesis summaries are updated every block based on new acoustic information. The authors also devise and test strategies to pass semantic context across the blocks, which improves the performance of the model. Specifically, the authors show that the proposed block-wise training method improves the ROUGE-L score by 3 points absolute compared to a truncated input baseline.

According to the provided documents, the most important feature in determining ChatGPT's relative ability to translate a language is the language's resource level. This is revealed in the document "ChatGPT MT: Competitive for High- (but Not Low-) Resource Languages" by David Mortensen and colleagues, where it is found that ChatGPT models approach or exceed traditional MT model performance for some high-resource languages but consistently lag for low-resource languages, under-performing traditional MT for 84.1% of languages covered. This suggests that the resource level of a language is the most important feature in determining ChatGPT's relative ability to translate it.
The proposed approach in the paper "Rethinking Voice-Face Correlation: A Geometry View" is a voice-anthropometric measurement (AM)-face paradigm, which identifies predictable facial AMs from the voice and uses them to guide 3D face reconstruction. By leveraging AMs as a proxy to link the voice and face geometry, the approach eliminates the influence of unpredictable AMs and makes the face geometry tractable. The proposed approach is evaluated on a proposed dataset with ground-truth 3D face scans and corresponding voice recordings, and significant correlations between voice and specific parts of the face geometry, such as the nasal cavity and cranium, are found.

This tech report describes the progress of the collaboration until December 2022, outlining the current state of the Personally Identifiable Information (PII) redaction pipeline, the experiments conducted to de-risk the model architecture, and the experiments investigating better preprocessing methods for the training data. We train 1.1B parameter models on the Java, JavaScript, and Python subsets of The Stack and evaluate them on the MultiPL-E text-to-code benchmark. We find that more aggressive filtering of near-duplicates can further boost performance and, surprisingly, that selecting files from repositories with 5+ GitHub stars deteriorates performance significantly. Our best model outperforms previous open-source multilingual code generation models (InCoder-6.7B and CodeGen-Multi-2.7B) in both left-to-right generation and infilling on the Java, JavaScript, and Python portions of MultiPL-E, despite being a substantially smaller model.

One limitation of lexical exact-match systems is the mismatch between lexical surface form and implicit term semantics. This limitation can lead to inefficient matching of queries and documents, resulting in reduced accuracy in text retrieval. To address this limitation, the paper proposes a framework that directly bridges the surface form space and the term semantics space in lexical exact-match retrieval via contextualized surface forms (CSFs). By learning to represent each query and document as a "bag-of-CSFs," the framework can efficiently match CSFs through exact-match of learned surface forms, leading to improved term match and term scoring.

Reciprocal rank is found to have a lack of sensitivity when discriminating between systems, particularly in modern evaluation settings where high-precision systems may be difficult to distinguish. This brittleness is addressed by introducing and connecting reciprocal rank to the concept of best-case retrieval, an evaluation method that focuses on assessing the quality of a ranking for the most satisfied possible user across possible recall requirements.
The proposed method for grounding pre-trained text-only language models to the visual domain involves leveraging the abilities of language models learned from large-scale text-only pretraining, such as in-context learning and free-form text generation. The language model is kept frozen, and the input and output linear layers are finetuned to enable cross-modality interactions. This allows the model to process arbitrarily interleaved image-and-text inputs and generate free-form text interleaved with retrieved images. The method achieves strong zero-shot performance on grounded tasks such as contextual image retrieval and multimodal dialogue, and showcases compelling interactive abilities. This approach works with any off-the-shelf language model and paves the way towards an effective, general solution for leveraging pretrained language models in visually grounded settings.

In the Unlimiformer approach, the cross-attention computation is offloaded to a single k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) index. This means that instead of attending to every key in the input sequence, the attention mechanism uses a kNN index to quickly retrieve the top-k keys and compute the attention scores. This approach allows the model to process even unlimited-length input sequences without any input truncation at test time.

The novel architecture introduced in the paper "Efficient Sequence Transduction by Jointly Predicting Tokens and Durations" is called the Token-and-Duration Transducer (TDT) architecture. TDT extends conventional RNN-Transducer architectures by jointly predicting both a token and its duration, i.e. the number of input frames covered by the emitted token. This is achieved by using a joint network with two outputs which are independently normalized to generate distributions over tokens and durations. During inference, TDT models can skip input frames guided by the predicted duration output, which makes them significantly faster than conventional Transducers which process the encoder output frame by frame. TDT models achieve both better accuracy and significantly faster inference than conventional Transducers on different sequence transduction tasks.
