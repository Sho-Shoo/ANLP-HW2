Doctoral Admissions page. In addition to the SCS guidelines, the LTI requires: A short (1-3 minute) video of yourself. There will be a prompt question that you will respond to. You will have three attempts. This is not a required part of the application process, but it's strongly suggested. Any outside funding you are receiving must be accompanied by an official award letter. No incomplete applications will be eligible for consideration. For specific application/admissions questions, please contact Stacey Young.
