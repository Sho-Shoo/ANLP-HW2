The abstract of Professor Eric P. Xing's paper on "StyleRF: Zero-Shot 3D Style Transfer of Neural Radiance Fields" is provided in the text. It describes a novel 3D style transfer technique called StyleRF that resolves the three-way dilemma between accurate geometry reconstruction, high-quality stylization, and generalizability to arbitrary new styles. StyleRF employs an explicit grid of high-level features to represent 3D scenes and achieves superior 3D stylization quality with precise geometry reconstruction and zero-shot style transfer.
