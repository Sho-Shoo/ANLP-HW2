Recent papers by Professor Yonatan Bisk include titles like "WebArena," "HomeRobot," and others focusing on autonomous agents, mobile manipulation, and object navigation.
Professor Graham Neubig's latest work features research on autonomous web agents, code evaluation, and long-range transformers, among others.
The paper "WebArena" by Professor Graham Neubig discusses creating a realistic web environment for language-guided autonomous agents, aimed at bridging the gap between synthetic environments and real-world tasks. It highlights the challenges of developing agents that can navigate and perform tasks on the web as effectively as humans, with a significant gap between current agent performance and human efficiency.
The abstract for "StyleRF" by Professor Eric P. Xing introduces StyleRF as a groundbreaking method for 3D style transfer that navigates the challenges of accurate geometry, quality stylization, and adaptability to new styles. It operates within the radiance field's feature space, ensuring precise geometry and high-quality style transfers without compromising on multi-view consistency or memory efficiency. StyleRF is distinguished by its innovative techniques for content transformation and style application, achieving superior results in 3D stylization across various styles.

The first freshman-level computer science course launched at CMU was the Logic Theorist.
The Robotics Institute started in 1979.
The authors of the paper 'Generalized Glossing Guidelines: An Explicit, Human- and Machine-Readable, Item-and-Process Convention for Morphological Annotation' are David R. Mortensen, Ela Gulsen, Taiqi He, Nathaniel R. Robinson, Jonathan D. Amith, Lindia Tjuatja, L. Levin.
Bisk is teaching Multimodal Machine Learning in Spring 2024.
MLT students are required to take 120 or more course units (about 10 courses), at least 72 of which are LTI courses, and 24 of which are School of Computer Science (SCS) courses. 
The first  Interfraternity Sweepstakes race was held in 1920.
Buggy is the vehicle being raced and also a nickname for the Sweepstakes.
Chute is a section of the freeroll portion of the buggy course (near the southwestern end of Frew Street at its intersection with Schenley Drive) where buggies make the sharp righthand turn from Schenley Drive onto Frew Street.
Chute Flagger is team member who provides a signal for buggy drivers to know when to start the right-hand turn from Schenley Drive onto Frew Street.
The driver in buggy races is person who travels with a buggy and controls the vehicles via steering and braking systems.
The pushbar in buggy races is the structure attached to a buggy that a person pushes to propel that buggy forward.
The pusher in buggy races is the person who propels a buggy via a pushbar along one of the five hills of the buggy course.
The shell in buggy races is the entire outer structure or covering of a buggy that determines that buggy's aerodynamic characteristics.
The transition in buggy races is the procedure whereby one pusher finishes pushing a buggy and the next pusher in sequence starts to push that same buggy.
The first Buggy Showcase took place in the Weigand Gymnasium in the Cohon University Center
You can find the academic calendar for PhD program at: https://www.cmu.edu/hub/calendar/index.html
The Language Technologies Institute is located on the 5th and 6th floors of the Gates Hillman Complex (GHC) on Carnegie Mellon’s Pittsburgh campus
The individuals responsible for administering the MIIS degree are Brianna Eriksen, Teruko Mitamura, Kate Schaich, Robert Frederking, and Mona Diab.
Students may request to transfer after completing their first semester and before the add/drop deadline of the spring semester.
A written request to the MIIS Program Director, as well as an explanation for the transfer, a proposed plan of study, a proposed advisor, and CMU transcripts based on the requirement of the MIIS Program Director. Current LTI students are not required to resubmit GRE and TOEFL/IELTS/Duolingo scores or new transcripts from other universities.
The duration of the MSDS program is 16 months, including a summer internship
The director of the MSAII program is Michael I. Shamos.
