Professor Yonatan Bisk has recently published two papers:  1. SPRING: Studying Papers and Reasoning to play Games (2023) - This paper, authored by Professor Bisk and his colleagues, introduces a new task called OUTDOOR, which involves using Large Language Models (LLMs) to accurately hallucinate possible futures in outdoor environments. The paper also proposes a new computationally aware success metric for pushing research forward in this more complex domain. 2. Reasoning about the Unseen for Efficient Outdoor Object Navigation (2023) - This paper, also authored by Professor Bisk, introduces a new mechanism for LLMs to reason about the unseen in outdoor environments. The paper shows impressive results on both a simulated drone and physical quadruped in outdoor environments, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.  Both papers were published in reputable conferences and journals, and have received significant attention in the field of artificial intelligence.
Professor Graham Neubig has recently published two papers:  1. "Divergences between Language Models and Human Brains" (2023) - This paper systematically explores the divergences between human and machine language processing by examining the differences between language model representations and human brain responses to language as measured by Magnetoencephalography (MEG) across two datasets. The study identifies two domains that are not captured well by language models: social/emotional intelligence and physical commonsense, and validates these domains with human behavioral experiments. 2. "EXCALIBUR: Encouraging and Evaluating Embodied Exploration" (2023) - This paper presents the EXCALIBUR benchmark, which allows agents to explore their environment for long durations and query their understanding of the physical world via inquiries. The design encourages agents to perform free-form home exploration without myopia induced by goal conditioning. The paper demonstrates the challenges posed by the EXCALIBUR dataset for present-day state-of-the-art embodied systems and the headroom afforded to develop new innovative methods.  Both papers were published in reputable conferences and journals and have received attention in the field of natural language processing and artificial intelligence.
The abstract of Professor Graham Neubig's paper on "WebArena" is:  "With advances in generative AI, there is now potential for autonomous agents to manage daily tasks via natural language commands. However, current agents are primarily created and tested in simplified synthetic environments, leading to a disconnect with real-world scenarios. In this paper, we build an environment for language-guided agents that is highly realistic and reproducible. Specifically, we focus on agents that perform tasks on the web, and create an environment with fully functional websites from four common domains: e-commerce, social forum discussions, collaborative software development, and content management. Our environment is enriched with tools (e.g., a map) and external knowledge bases (e.g., user manuals) to encourage human-like task-solving. Building upon our environment, we release a set of benchmark tasks focusing on evaluating the functional correctness of task completions. The tasks in our benchmark are diverse, long-horizon, and designed to emulate tasks that humans routinely perform on the internet. We experiment with several baseline agents, integrating recent techniques such as reasoning before acting. The results demonstrate that solving complex tasks is challenging: our best GPT-4-based agent only achieves an end-to-end task success rate of 14.41%, significantly lower than the human performance of 78.24%. These results highlight the need for further development of robust agents, that current state-of-the-art large language models are far from perfect performance in these real-life tasks, and that WebArena can be used to measure such progress."
The abstract of Professor Eric P. Xing's paper on "StyleRF: Zero-Shot 3D Style Transfer of Neural Radiance Fields" is:  "3D style transfer aims to render stylized novel views of a 3D scene with multiview consistency. However, most existing work suffers from a three-way dilemma over accurate geometry reconstruction, high-quality stylization, and being generalizable to arbitrary new styles. We propose StyleRF (Style Radiance Fields), an innovative 3D style transfer technique that resolves the three-way dilemma by performing style transformation within the feature space of a radiance field. StyleRF employs an explicit grid of high-level features to represent 3D scenes, with which high-fidelity geometry can be reliably restored via volume rendering. In addition, it transforms the grid features according to the reference style, which directly leads to high-quality zero-shot style transfer. StyleRF consists of two innovative designs: sampling-invariant content transformation and deferred style transformation of 2D feature maps. Extensive experiments show that StyleRF achieves superior 3D stylization quality with precise geometry reconstruction and can generalize to various new styles in a zero-shot manner."

The first Interfraternity Sweepstakes race was held in 1923. According to the document, "1923 Buggy rules change to include a permanent driver and four pushers along the course; 1928 Campus Week is discontinued, but students continue the celebration, calling it Spring Carnival, which now features Buggy and Booth competitions; 1928 Independent organizations, other than fraternities, enter Buggy for the first time." This suggests that the first Interfraternity Sweepstakes race was held in 1923, during the Spring Carnival celebration.
Buggy refers to a vehicle designed for racing, typically with a low profile and a pushbar for propulsion, used in the Spring Carnival event at Carnegie Mellon University.
Chute is not a term mentioned in the provided DOCUMENTS. Therefore, I don't know the answer to your question.
The driver in Buggy Races is the person who travels with the buggy and controls the vehicle via steering and braking systems.
The pushbar in Buggy Races is a structure attached to a buggy that a person pushes to propel that buggy forward.
The pusher in Buggy Races is a person who propels a buggy forward via a pushbar. The pusher is an essential member of the team, as they provide the power and momentum needed to navigate the buggy course. The pusher works in coordination with the driver to ensure a successful race.
The shell in Buggy Races refers to the entire outer structure or covering of a buggy that determines its aerodynamic characteristics.
The transition in Buggy Races, as described in the paper "Reasoning about the Unseen for Efficient Outdoor Object Navigation" by LTI Prof. Yonantan Bisk, is the ability of humans to reason about the unseen in outdoor environments. This refers to the ability to navigate and make decisions in environments that lack clear spatial delineations and are riddled with inherent semantic ambiguities. The paper introduces a new task called OUTDOOR, which aims to develop a mechanism for Large Language Models (LLMs) to accurately hallucinate possible futures in outdoor environments. The paper also introduces a new computationally aware success metric for pushing research forward in this more complex domain.
The Buggy Showcase took place in Weigand Gymnasium in the Cohon University Center in 2019.

The authors of the paper "AV-SUPERB: A Multi-Task Evaluation Benchmark for Audio-Visual Representation Models" are LTI Prof. Shinji Watanabe and other co-authors. The main proposal of this research paper is to create a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the performance of audio-visual representation models on multiple tasks, including speech and audio processing tasks. The authors propose the AV-SUPERB benchmark, which provides a set of evaluation instances that cover 5 audio-visual tasks and 7 datasets, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed benchmark by evaluating 5 recent self-supervised models. The paper also discusses the importance of improving the generalization ability of learned representations and the potential of using intermediate-task fine-tuning and audio event classification with AudioSet to improve performance.

The main objective of their research is to propose a task and domain-agnostic framework called FacTool for detecting factual errors in texts generated by large language models, such as ChatGPT. The authors aim to address the challenges of identifying factual errors in generated texts, which are becoming increasingly common due to the emergence of generative AI models. FacTool is designed to be flexible and adaptable to different tasks and domains, and it demonstrates its efficacy through experiments on four different tasks.
The Batch Embedding Covariance Regularization (BECR) proposed by Bhiksha Raj and his team in their paper "Approach to Learning Generalized Audio Representation Through Batch Embedding Covariance Regularization and Constant-Q Transforms" is a term that aims to uncover a more holistic simulation of the frequency information received by the human auditory system. It is a regularization term that is added to the model's loss function to encourage the learned representations to have a more robust and diverse structure, which can improve the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.  In the paper, the authors propose to use BECR in conjunction with a Batch Embedding (BE) layer, which is a type of neural network layer that maps the input audio signals to a dense vector representation. The BECR term is added to the loss function of the BE layer, and it encourages the learned representations to have a more even and consistent distribution across the frequency spectrum.  The BECR term is computed as the difference between the covariance matrix of the learned representations and a target covariance matrix that is computed based on the human auditory system's frequency response. The target covariance matrix is a diagonal matrix with non-zero entries on the diagonal, which represents the relative importance of each frequency band in the human auditory system. By minimizing the difference between the covariance matrix of the learned representations and the target covariance matrix, the model is encouraged to learn representations that are more similar to the human auditory system's frequency response.  Overall, the BECR term is a useful regularization term that can help improve the quality of the learned representations in audio processing tasks, and it can be particularly useful when the goal is to learn representations that are more similar to the human auditory system's frequency response.

In-context knowledge editing (IKE), a new paradigm for editing factual knowledge in large language models (LLMs), was explored without any gradient and parameter updating. 2. Experiments were conducted on GPT-J, a 6B parameter language model, and the results showed that IKE achieved a competitive success rate compared to gradient-based methods but with much fewer side effects. 3. IKE was applied to larger LLMs like OPT-175B, which showed the scalability of the method. 4. The study demonstrated that IKE can edit factual knowledge in LLMs without modifying the parameters, which has important implications for practical applications.  In summary, the paper explored a new approach to editing factual knowledge in LLMs using in-context learning, which showed promising results in terms of success rate and side effects.
The novel approach proposed by Rita Singh and Wayne Zhao in their 2023 paper titled "Deriving Vocal Fold Oscillation Information from Recorded Voice Signals Using Models of Phonation" is an analysis-by-synthesis approach that allows for the direct derivation of vocal fold oscillation (VFO) information from recorded speech signals on an individualized, speaker-by-speaker basis. The approach, called the ADLES-VFT algorithm, combines a phonation model and a vocal tract acoustic wave propagation model to estimate the individualized VFOs of a speaker. The ADLES-VFT algorithm is a forward-backward algorithm that minimizes the error between the recorded waveform and the output of the joint model to estimate its parameters, which are then used to obtain the individualized VFOs. This approach is flexible and can be applied to various phonation models, and the authors show how the VFOs can be quantified from a dynamical systems perspective for classification purposes.

The main proposal of the paper "Generating Images with Multimodal Language Models" is to fuse frozen text-only large language models (LLMs) with pre-trained image encoder and decoder models by mapping between their embedding spaces. The proposed method demonstrates a wide suite of multimodal capabilities, including image retrieval, novel image generation, and multimodal dialogue. The authors propose an efficient mapping network to ground the LLM to an off-the-shelf text-to-image generation model, which enables the model to leverage the strong text representations of the LLM for visual outputs. The approach outperforms baseline generation models on tasks with longer and more complex language.
