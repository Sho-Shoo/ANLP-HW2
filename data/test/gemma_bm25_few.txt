The abstract of Professor Eric P. Xing's paper on "StyleRF: Zero-Shot 3D Style Transfer of Neural Radiance Fields" describes a novel technique for 3D style transfer that resolves the three-way dilemma between accurate geometry reconstruction, high-quality stylization, and generalizability to arbitrary new styles. StyleRF achieves superior 3D stylization quality with precise geometry reconstruction and can generalize to various new styles in a zero-shot manner.
