Graham Neubig is a professor at Carnegie Mellon University's Language Technology Institute (LTI). Recently, he has published several papers on various topics related to natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. Here are some of his recent papers:  1. "A Gold Standard Dataset for the Reviewer Assignment Problem" (2023) - This paper presents a novel dataset of similarity scores provided by 58 researchers who evaluated their expertise in reviewing papers they have read previously. The dataset is used to compare several popular algorithms employed in computer science conferences and provide recommendations for stakeholders. 2. "Program-Aided Reasoners (Better) Know What They Know" (2023) - This paper explores the use of program-aided reasoners to improve the performance of language models in natural language generation tasks. The authors show that program-aided reasoners can provide better performance than text-based counterparts in certain datasets. 3. "Alignment for Honesty: Ensuring that LLMs Proactively Refuse to Answer Questions When They Lack Knowledge" (2023) - This paper argues for the importance of alignment in ensuring that large language models (LLMs) proactively refuse to answer questions when they lack knowledge. The authors propose a pivotal aspect of alignment for honesty, which is to automatically choose what to mask during continued pretraining by considering what makes a task domain different from the pretraining domain. 4. "Quantifying & Modeling Multimodal Interactions: An Information Decomposition Framework" (2023) - This paper presents an overview of the recent research that has leveraged human feedback to improve natural language generation and the nascent field of AI feedback. The authors propose an information decomposition framework to quantify the interactions necessary to solve a multimodal task and develop suitable multimodal models. 5. "Learning to Filter Context for Retrieval-Augmented Generation" (2023) - This paper explores the use of program-aided reasoners to improve the performance of language models in natural language generation tasks. The authors show that program-aided reasoners can provide better performance than text-based counterparts in certain datasets. 6. "EXCALIBUR: Encouraging and Evaluating Embodied Exploration" (2023) - This paper presents a framework for encouraging and evaluating embodied exploration in AI systems. The authors propose a novel dataset of culturally valuable documents and demonstrate that utilizing OCR reduces the time spent in the manual transcription of culturally valuable documents by over 50%. 7. "Difference-Masking: A Novel Masking Strategy for Improving Language Model Performance" (2023) - This paper introduces a novel masking strategy called difference-masking, which automatically chooses what to mask during continued pretraining by considering what makes a task domain different from the pretraining domain. The authors show that difference-masking can improve the performance of language models in natural language generation tasks.  These are just a few of the recent papers published by Professor Graham Neubig. His work spans a wide range of topics in NLP and machine learning, and he is widely recognized as an expert in the field.

The abstract of Professor Eric P. Xing's paper on "StyleRF: Zero-Shot 3D Style Transfer of Neural Radiance Fields" is:  "3D style transfer aims to render stylized novel views of a 3D scene with multiview consistency. However, most existing work suffers from a three-way dilemma over accurate geometry reconstruction, high-quality stylization, and being generalizable to arbitrary new styles. We propose StyleRF (Style Radiance Fields), an innovative 3D style transfer technique that resolves the three-way dilemma by performing style transformation within the feature space of a radiance field. StyleRF employs an explicit grid of high-level features to represent 3D scenes, with which high-fidelity geometry can be reliably restored via volume rendering. In addition, it transforms the grid features according to the reference style, which directly leads to high-quality zero-shot style transfer. StyleRF consists of two innovative designs: sampling-invariant content transformation and deferred style transformation of 2D feature maps. Extensive experiments show that StyleRF achieves superior 3D stylization quality with precise geometry reconstruction and it can generalize to various new styles in a zero-shot manner.
