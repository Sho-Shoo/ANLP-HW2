The abstract of Professor Eric P. Xing's paper on "StyleRF: Zero-Shot 3D Style Transfer of Neural Radiance Fields" is:  "3D style transfer aims to render stylized novel views of a 3D scene with multiview consistency. However, most existing work suffers from a three-way dilemma over accurate geometry reconstruction, high-quality stylization, and being generalizable to arbitrary new styles. We propose StyleRF (Style Radiance Fields), an innovative 3D style transfer technique that resolves the three-way dilemma by performing style transformation within the feature space of a radiance field. StyleRF employs an explicit grid of high-level features to represent 3D scenes, with which high-fidelity geometry can be reliably restored via volume rendering. In addition, it transforms the grid features according to the reference style, which directly leads to high-quality zero-shot style transfer. StyleRF consists of two innovative designs: sampling-invariant content transformation and deferred style transformation of 2D feature maps. Extensive experiments show that StyleRF achieves superior 3D stylization quality with precise geometry reconstruction and it can generalize to various new styles in a zero-shot manner. Project website: <https://kunhao-liu.github.io/StyleRF/>; Year: 2023; Venue: Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition; Citations: 12; TLDR: {'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'StyleRF (Style Radiance Fields), an innovative 3D style transfer technique that resolves the three-way dilemma by performing style transformation within the feature space of a radiance field, achieves superior 3D stylization quality with precise geometry reconstruction and it can generalize to various new styles in a zero-shot manner.'}"

The main proposal of this research paper is to introduce the AV-SUPERB benchmark, which is a general-purpose evaluation platform for unimodal audio/visual and bimodal fusion representations on 7 datasets covering 5 audio-visual tasks in speech and audio processing. The authors evaluate 5 recent self-supervised models and show that none of these models generalize to all tasks, highlighting the need for future research on improving universal model performance. They also demonstrate the importance of audio-visual representation learning by showing that representations can be improved with intermediate-task fine-tuning and audio event classification with AudioSet serves as a strong intermediate task.
The authors of the paper titled "FacTool: Factuality Detection in Generative AI - A Tool Augmented Framework for Multi-Task and Multi-Domain Scenarios" are Ethan Chern, Steffi Chern, Shiqi Chen, Weizhe Yuan, Kehua Feng, Chunting Zhou, Junxian He, Graham Neubig, and Pengfei Liu.  The main objective of their research is to propose a task- and domain-agnostic framework for detecting factual errors in texts generated by large language models, such as ChatGPT. They present the FacTool framework, which integrates a factuality detection module with a set of plugins for different tasks, including knowledge-based QA, code generation, mathematical reasoning, and scientific literature review. The framework is evaluated on four different tasks, showing its efficacy in identifying factual errors in generated texts.
The Batch Embedding Covariance Regularization (BECR) proposed by Bhiksha Raj and his team in their paper "Approach to Learning Generalized Audio Representation Through Batch Embedding Covariance Regularization and Constant-Q Transforms" is a regularization term that aims to uncover a more holistic simulation of the frequency information received by the human auditory system. The BECR term is used in the context of audio representation learning, where the goal is to learn a compact and informative representation of audio signals that can be used for various tasks such as speech recognition, music information retrieval, and audio enhancement. By adding the BECR term to the loss function, the model is encouraged to learn a representation that captures the covariance structure of the audio data, which can help improve the generalization ability of the model to unseen data.
The research paper "Can We Edit Factual Knowledge by In-Context Learning?" authored by Lei Li and his team investigates the potential of in-context learning (ICL) to edit factual knowledge in large language models (LLMs). The key findings of the study can be summarized as follows:  1. In-context knowledge editing (IKE) achieves competitive success rates compared to gradient-based methods on GPT-J (6B) but with fewer side effects, such as less over-editing on similar but unrelated facts and less knowledge forgetting on previously stored knowledge. 2. The proposed IKE method is scalable and can be applied to larger LLMs with tens or hundreds of parameters, such as OPT-175B. 3. The study demonstrates the efficacy of ICL in editing factual knowledge in LLMs without updating the model's parameters. 4. The selection and number of in-context examples affect the performance of IKE, and the optimal number of examples can be determined based on the task and the LLM's size. 5. IKE can be used to evaluate zero-shot summaries written by LLMs such as GPT-3, which is a promising application of ICL in natural language processing.  Overall, the research suggests that ICL is a promising approach for editing factual knowledge in LLMs without the need for large-scale training data, which can be time-consuming and computationally expensive.
Rita Singh and Wayne Zhao propose a novel analysis-by-synthesis approach in their 2023 paper titled "Deriving Vocal Fold Oscillation Information from Recorded Voice Signals Using Models of Phonation." This approach, called the ADLES-VFT algorithm, allows for the estimation of vocal fold oscillations (VFOs) directly from recorded speech signals on an individualized, speaker-by-speaker basis. The ADLES-VFT algorithm is a forward-backward algorithm that minimizes the error between the recorded waveform and the output of a joint model combining a phonation model and a vocal tract acoustic wave propagation model. Once estimated, these parameters are used in conjunction with a phonation model to obtain individualized VFOs for each speaker. The approach is flexible and can be applied to various phonation models, and the VFOs can be quantified from a dynamical systems perspective for classification purposes.

The research paper "Computational Language Acquisition with Theory of Mind" by Yonatan Bisk and colleagues (2023) found several interesting insights related to language acquisition and the role of theory of mind (ToM) in this process. Here are some of the key findings:  1. Training speakers with a highly weighted ToM listener component leads to performance gains in the authors' image referential game setting. This suggests the potential utility of further incorporating ToM, as well as other insights from child language acquisition, into computational models of language acquisition. 2. The authors experimented with varying task difficulty and found that models acquire more complex language to adapt to stronger environmental pressures. This is consistent with the idea that language acquisition is an iterative process that involves learning and adaptation in response to changing environmental demands. 3. The authors found some evidence that increasing task difficulty in the training process results in more fluent and precise utterances in evaluation. This suggests that language acquisition is a graded process that involves a continuous trade-off between complexity and accuracy. 4. The study demonstrates the potential of using ToM to improve language learning in AI systems. By incorporating insights from child language acquisition and cognitive science, researchers can develop more effective and efficient language learning algorithms.  Overall, the paper provides valuable insights into the role of ToM in language acquisition and highlights the potential of interdisciplinary approaches to developing more advanced language learning algorithms.

CONTEXT START  affective phenomena, such as affect and emotions, during human-human and human-machine interactions. This paper describes our examination of research at the intersection of multimodal interaction and affective computing, with the objective of observing trends and identifying understudied areas. We examined over 16,000 papers from selected conferences in multimodal interaction, affective computing, and natural language processing: ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interaction, AAAC International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction, Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, and Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing. We identified 910 affect-related papers and present our analysis of the role of affective phenomena in these papers. We find that this body of research has primarily focused on enabling machines to recognize or express affect and emotion; there has been limited research on how affect and emotion predictions might, in turn, be used by AI systems to enhance machine understanding of human social behaviors and cognitive states. Based on our analysis, we discuss directions to expand the role of affective phenomena in multimodal interaction research. | Year: 2023 | Venue: International Conference on Multimodal Interaction | Citations: 0 | TLDR: {'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'An examination of research at the intersection of multimodal interaction and affective computing, with the objective of observing trends and identifying understudied areas, finds that this body of research has primarily focused on enabling machines to recognize or express affect and emotion.'}  CONTEXT END
The publication venue of the paper "BASS: Block-wise Adaptation for Speech Summarization" is Interspeech.  CONTEXT START  Author (LTI's Professor): Bhiksha Raj; Title: BASS: Block-wise Adaptation for Speech Summarization; Authors: Roshan Sharma, Kenneth Zheng, Siddhant Arora, Shinji Watanabe, Rita Singh, B. Raj; Abstract: End-to-end speech summarization has been shown to improve performance over cascade baselines. However, such models are difficult to train on very large inputs (dozens of minutes or hours) owing to compute restrictions and are hence trained with truncated model inputs. Truncation leads to poorer models, and a solution to this problem rests in block-wise modeling, i.e., processing a portion of the input frames at a time. In this paper, we develop a method that allows one to train summarization models on very long sequences in an incremental manner. Speech summarization is realized as a streaming process, where hypothesis summaries are updated every block based on new acoustic information. We devise and test strategies to pass semantic context across the blocks. Experiments on the How2 dataset demonstrate that the proposed block-wise training method improves by 3 points absolute on ROUGE-L over a truncated input baseline. | Year:2023 | Venue:Interspeech | Citations:1 | TLDR:{'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'This paper develops a method that allows one to train summarization models on very long sequences in an incremental manner and devise and test strategies to pass semantic context across the blocks.'}  CONTEXT END

The main proposal of the paper "Generating Images with Multimodal Language Models" is to fuse frozen text-only large language models (LLMs) with pre-trained image encoder and decoder models, by mapping between their embedding spaces. The authors aim to demonstrate a wider range of capabilities compared to prior multimodal language models, including image retrieval, novel image generation, and multimodal dialogue. They propose an efficient mapping network to ground the LLM to an off-the-shelf text-to-image generation model, which translates hidden representations of the LLM into the embedding space of the visual models, enabling the use of strong text representations of the LLM for visual outputs. The authors achieve strong performance on image generation tasks and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in generating coherent image outputs that are conditioned on arbitrary interleaved image and text inputs.
