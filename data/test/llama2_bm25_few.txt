The abstract of Professor Eric P. Xing's paper on "StyleRF: Zero-Shot 3D Style Transfer of Neural Radiance Fields" is:  "3D style transfer aims to render stylized novel views of a 3D scene with multiview consistency. However, most existing work suffers from a three-way dilemma over accurate geometry reconstruction, high-quality stylization, and being generalizable to arbitrary new styles. We propose StyleRF (Style Radiance Fields), an innovative 3D style transfer technique that resolves the three-way dilemma by performing style transformation within the feature space of a radiance field. StyleRF employs an explicit grid of high-level features to represent 3D scenes, with which high-fidelity geometry can be reliably restored via volume rendering. In addition, it transforms the grid features according to the reference style, which directly leads to high-quality zero-shot style transfer. StyleRF consists of two innovative designs: sampling-invariant content transformation and deferred style transformation of 2D feature maps. Extensive experiments show that StyleRF achieves superior 3D stylization quality with precise geometry reconstruction and it can generalize to various new styles in a zero-shot manner."

The driver in Buggy Races is the person who travels with the buggy and controls the vehicle via steering and braking systems.
The pushbar in Buggy Races is a structure attached to a buggy that a person pushes to propel that buggy forward.
The pusher in Buggy Races is a person who propels a buggy forward by pushing a pushbar attached to the buggy. The pusher helps the driver control the speed and direction of the buggy during the race.
The shell in Buggy Races refers to the entire outer structure or covering of a buggy that determines that buggy's aerodynamic characteristics. It plays a crucial role in the buggy's speed and handling during the race.
The transition in Buggy Races refers to the procedure whereby one pusher finishes pushing a buggy and the next pusher in sequence starts to push that same buggy. This process is an important part of the race, as it allows the buggy to continue moving forward without interruption. The transition is typically smooth and seamless, with the pushers working together to ensure a smooth handoff.
