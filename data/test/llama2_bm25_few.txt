The abstract of Professor Eric P. Xing's paper on "StyleRF: Zero-Shot 3D Style Transfer of Neural Radiance Fields" is:  "3D style transfer aims to render stylized novel views of a 3D scene with multiview consistency. However, most existing work suffers from a three-way dilemma over accurate geometry reconstruction, high-quality stylization, and being generalizable to arbitrary new styles. We propose StyleRF (Style Radiance Fields), an innovative 3D style transfer technique that resolves the three-way dilemma by performing style transformation within the feature space of a radiance field, achieving superior 3D stylization quality with precise geometry reconstruction and it can generalize to various new styles in a zero-shot manner. StyleRF employs an explicit grid of high-level features to represent 3D scenes, with which high-fidelity geometry can be reliably restored via volume rendering. In addition, it transforms the grid features according to the reference style, which directly leads to high-quality zero-shot style transfer. StyleRF consists of two innovative designs: sampling-invariant content transformation and deferred style transformation of 2D feature maps. The former makes the transformation invariant to the holistic statistics of the sampled 3D points and accordingly ensures multi-view consistency. The latter is equivalent to the transformation of 3D points but greatly reduces memory usage. Extensive experiments show that StyleRF achieves state-of-the-art performance on various 3D style transfer tasks while maintaining high-quality geometry reconstruction and preserving content integrity."
