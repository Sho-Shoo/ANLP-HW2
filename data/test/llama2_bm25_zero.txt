"Quantifying & Modeling Multimodal Interactions: An Information Decomposition Framework" (2023) - This paper presents an overview of the recent research that has leveraged human feedback to improve natural language generation and the nascent field of AI feedback. The authors propose an information decomposition framework to quantify the interactions that are necessary to solve a multimodal task and model the most suitable multimodal models for a given task. 5. "EXCALIBUR: Encouraging and Evaluating Embodied Exploration" (2023) - This paper presents a novel framework for encouraging and evaluating embodied exploration in AI agents. The authors propose a set of algorithms and techniques to enable machines to explore their environment in a more human-like manner.

The abstract of Professor Eric P. Xing's paper on "StyleRF: Zero-Shot 3D Style Transfer of Neural Radiance Fields" is as follows:  "3D style transfer aims to render stylized novel views of a 3D scene with multiview consistency. However, most existing work suffers from a three-way dilemma over accurate geometry reconstruction, high-quality stylization, and being generalizable to arbitrary new styles. We propose StyleRF (Style Radiance Fields), an innovative 3D style transfer technique that resolves the three-way dilemma by performing style transformation within the feature space of a radiance field. StyleRF employs an explicit grid of high-level features to represent 3D scenes, with which high-fidelity geometry can be reliably restored via volume rendering. In addition, it transforms the grid features according to the reference style, which directly leads to high-quality zero-shot style transfer. StyleRF consists of two innovative designs: sampling-invariant content transformation and deferred style transformation of 2D feature maps. Extensive experiments show that StyleRF achieves superior 3D stylization quality with precise geometry reconstruction and it can generalize to various new styles in a zero-shot manner. Project website: <https://kunhao-liu.github.io/StyleRF/>; Year: 2023; Venue: Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition; Citations: 12; TLDR: {'model': 'tldr@v2.0.0', 'text': 'StyleRF (Style Radiance Fields), an innovative 3D style transfer technique that resolves the three-way dilemma by performing style transformation within the feature space of a radiance field, achieves superior 3D stylization quality with precise geometry reconstruction and it can generalize to various new styles in a zero-shot manner.'}"  I hope this helps!
