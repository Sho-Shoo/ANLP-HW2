The abstract of Professor Eric P. Xing's paper on "StyleRF: Zero-Shot 3D Style Transfer of Neural Radiance Fields" can be summarized as follows:  "3D style transfer aims to render stylized novel views of a 3D scene with multiview consistency. However, most existing work suffers from a three-way dilemma over accurate geometry reconstruction, high-quality stylization, and being generalizable to arbitrary new styles. We propose StyleRF (Style Radiance Fields), an innovative 3D style transfer technique that resolves the three-way dilemma by performing style transformation within the feature space of a radiance field. StyleRF employs an explicit grid of high-level features to represent 3D scenes, with which high-fidelity geometry can be reliably restored via volume rendering. In addition, it transforms the grid features according to the reference style, which directly leads to high-quality zero-shot style transfer. StyleRF consists of two innovative designs: sampling-invariant content transformation and deferred style transformation of 2D feature maps. Extensive experiments show that StyleRF achieves superior 3D stylization quality with precise geometry reconstruction and it can generalize to various new styles in a zero-shot manner. Project website: https://kunhao-liu.github.io/StyleRF/. Year: 2023. Venue: Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. Citations: 12."  In summary, Professor Eric P. Xing's paper proposes a novel 3D style transfer technique called StyleRF, which resolves the three-way dilemma in 3D style transfer by performing style transformation within the feature space of a radiance field. The proposed method employs an explicit grid of high-level features to represent 3D scenes and achieves superior 3D stylization quality with precise geometry reconstruction. Additionally, StyleRF can generalize to various new styles in a zero-shot manner, making it a promising approach for 3D style transfer applications.

The authors evaluate 5 recent self-supervised models and show that none of these models generalize to all tasks, highlighting the need for future research on improving universal model performance. They also demonstrate the potential benefits of fine-tuning and audio event classification with AudioSet, which serves as a strong intermediate task. The AV-SUPERB benchmark is released with an evaluation code and a model submission platform to encourage further research in audio-visual learning.

BECR is proposed to improve the PaSST model without incurring extra computation complexity. The BECR term is experimented with different front-end audio preprocessing methods, including Constant-Q Transform (CQT) and Short-time Fourier transform (STFT), and is found to improve the performance of the model on various tasks.
The research paper "Can We Edit Factual Knowledge by In-Context Learning?" authored by Lei Li and his team explores the potential of in-context learning for editing factual knowledge in large language models (LLMs). The key findings of the paper can be summarized as follows:  1. In-context learning (ICL) is a promising approach for editing factual knowledge in LLMs without updating the model's parameters. 2. The authors conduct a comprehensive empirical study of ICL strategies on the GPT-J model and demonstrate its competitiveness with gradient-based methods in terms of success rate. 3. The authors also apply the ICL method to larger LLMs with tens or hundreds of parameters, such as OPT-175B, and show its scalability. 4. The experiments show that IKE, a specific ICL strategy, achieves a competitive success rate compared to gradient-based methods on GPT-J but with fewer side effects, such as over-editing on similar but unrelated facts and knowledge forgetting on previously stored knowledge. 5. The study demonstrates the potential of ICL for editing factual knowledge in LLMs and its potential applications in various domains, such as text summarization, question answering, and knowledge grounding.  In summary, the paper shows that in-context learning is a promising approach for editing factual knowledge in large language models without updating the model's parameters, and it has the potential to be applied in various domains.
The novel approach proposed by Rita Singh and Wayne Zhao in their 2023 paper titled "Deriving Vocal Fold Oscillation Information from Recorded Voice Signals Using Models of Phonation" is a forward-backward algorithm called the ADLES-VFT algorithm, which minimizes the error between the recorded waveform and the output of a joint model that combines a phonation model (with a glottal flow waveform as the output) and a vocal tract acoustic wave propagation model. The algorithm is proposed in the context of a joint model that correlates the physical properties of the vocal folds of the speaker with the output of the joint model, providing individualized VFOs for each speaker. The approach is flexible and can be applied to various phonation models, and the VFOs can be quantified from a dynamical systems perspective for classification purposes.

The key contribution of the paper "Speaker-Independent Acoustic-to-Articulatory Speech Inversion" is the proposed acoustic-to-articulatory inversion (AAI) model, which leverages autoregression, adversarial training, and self-supervision to generalize to unseen speakers and obtain a correlation of 0.784 on an electromagnetic articulography (EMA) dataset. This model represents a significant improvement over previous methods, which have largely relied on manual annotation of articulatory data. The AAI model demonstrates the potential for using machine learning techniques to infer the articulatory parameters of speech from acoustic inputs, without requiring direct access to the speaker's articulatory system. This has important implications for the development of speech processing methods that can handle speech as naturally as humans, and could potentially enable more accurate and efficient speech recognition systems.

The main finding of the paper "Do All Languages Cost the Same? Tokenization in the Era of Commercial Language Models" is that the cost of using language models varies greatly depending on the language being used, with some languages being overcharged while obtaining poorer results. The authors analyze the effect of non-uniformity in tokenization on the fairness of API pricing policies across languages and show evidence that speakers of a large number of supported languages are overcharged while obtaining poorer results. They also suggest that this issue may be due to the lack of transparency around language model APIs' pricing policies and encourage vendors to make them more equitable.
