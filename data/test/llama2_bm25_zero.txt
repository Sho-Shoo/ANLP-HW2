The abstract of Professor Eric P. Xing's paper on "StyleRF: Zero-Shot 3D Style Transfer of Neural Radiance Fields" is:  "3D style transfer aims to render stylized novel views of a 3D scene with multiview consistency. However, most existing work suffers from a three-way dilemma over accurate geometry reconstruction, high-quality stylization, and being generalizable to arbitrary new styles. We propose StyleRF (Style Radiance Fields), an innovative 3D style transfer technique that resolves the three-way dilemma by performing style transformation within the feature space of a radiance field, achieving superior 3D stylization quality with precise geometry reconstruction and it can generalize to various new styles in a zero-shot manner. Extensive experiments show that StyleRF achieves state-of-the-art performance on various 3D style transfer benchmarks."
