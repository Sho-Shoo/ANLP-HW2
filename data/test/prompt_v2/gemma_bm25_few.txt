Sure, here is the abstract of Professor Eric P. Xing's paper on "StyleRF: Zero-Shot 3D Style Transfer of Neural Radiance Fields":  StyleRF (Style Radiance Fields) is an innovative 3D style transfer technique that resolves the three-way dilemma between accurate geometry reconstruction, high-quality stylization, and generalizability to arbitrary new styles. It employs an explicit grid of high-level features to represent 3D scenes and transforms the grid features according to the reference style to achieve high-quality zero-shot style transfer. StyleRF consists of two innovative designs: sampling-invariant content transformation and deferred style transformation of 2D feature maps. Experimental results demonstrate that StyleRF achieves superior 3D stylization quality with precise geometry reconstruction and generalizability to various new styles.
