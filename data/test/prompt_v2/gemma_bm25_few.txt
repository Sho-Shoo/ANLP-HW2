Sure, here is the abstract of Professor Eric P. Xing's paper on "StyleRF: Zero-Shot 3D Style Transfer of Neural Radiance Fields":  StyleRF is an innovative 3D style transfer technique that resolves the three-way dilemma over accurate geometry reconstruction, high-quality stylization, and being generalizable to arbitrary new styles. It employs an explicit grid of high-level features to represent 3D scenes and transforms the grid features according to the reference style to achieve high-quality zero-shot style transfer. StyleRF consists of two innovative designs: sampling-invariant content transformation and deferred style transformation of 2D feature maps. Extensive experiments show that StyleRF achieves superior 3D stylization quality with precise geometry reconstruction and generalizes well to various new styles in a zero-shot manner.
