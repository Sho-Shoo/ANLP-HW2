Sure, here are Professor Yonatan Bisk's recent papers:  * **SigMoreFun Submission to the SIGMORPHON** (2023) - This paper introduces a novel dataset of similarity scores and compares several popular algorithms employed in computer science conferences. * **Plan, Eliminate, and Track - Language Models are Good Teachers for Embodied Agents** (2023) - This paper explores the ability of pre-trained large language models to generate abstract plans and their effectiveness in simplifying control tasks.
Based on the provided documents, Professor Graham Neubig has authored several recent papers. They include:  * **SigMoreFun Submission to the SIGMORPHON:** This paper introduces a novel dataset of similarity scores and compares several popular algorithms for conference paper ranking. * **Alignment for Honesty:** This paper argues for the importance of alignment for honesty in large language models and introduces a new masking strategy called Difference-Masking. * **Learning to Filter Context for Retrieval-Augmented Generation:** This paper explores the use of on-the-fly retrieval of relevant knowledge for text generation tasks.  Therefore, the most relevant paper for the question is **SigMoreFun Submission to the SIGMORPHON**, as it directly addresses the question about Professor Neubig's recent papers.

The abstract of Professor Eric P. Xing's paper on "StyleRF: Zero-Shot 3D Style Transfer of Neural Radiance Fields" is as follows:  StyleRF (Style Radiance Fields) is an innovative 3D style transfer technique that resolves the three-way dilemma over accurate geometry reconstruction, high-quality stylization, and being generalizable to arbitrary new styles. It achieves superior 3D stylization quality with precise geometry reconstruction and can generalize to various new styles in a zero-shot manner.
