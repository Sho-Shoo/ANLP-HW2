The abstract of Professor Eric P. Xing's paper on "StyleRF: Zero-Shot 3D Style Transfer of Neural Radiance Fields" is as follows:  StyleRF is an innovative 3D style transfer technique that resolves the three-way dilemma between accurate geometry reconstruction, high-quality stylization, and generalizability to arbitrary new styles. It employs an explicit grid of high-level features to represent 3D scenes and transforms the grid features according to the reference style to achieve high-quality zero-shot style transfer. Experimental results demonstrate superior 3D stylization quality with precise geometry reconstruction and generalizability to various new styles.
