The paper "Generating Images with Multimodal Language Models" proposes a method to fuse frozen text-only large language models (LLMs) with pre-trained image encoder and decoder models, by mapping between their embedding spaces. This method enables the model to process image-and-text inputs, generate images, and retrieve images from a prespecified dataset.
