The women's heats were run for the first time in the Buggy race in 1979.
The two-wheeled buggy was eliminated in 1989.
The first all-women's team in buggy history was Kappa Kappa Gamma in 2004.
The text states that "Clarke would go on to receive the Turing Award for his role in the development of model checking." Therefore, there is one member affiliated with CMU that has won a Turing Award.
The text mentions 13 Academy Awards won by alumni and current or former faculty of CMU.
The text does not mention Kevlar Fiber, therefore I do not have an answer to this question.
Andrew Carnegie passed away in 1919. The text states that "Carnegie died in 1919, but his vision for an educated public lived on after him."
The text does not mention the official Carnegie Mellon tartan, therefore I cannot answer this question.
The survey results showed that 78% of 2,370 students surveyed in February 2007 voted for the Scottish terrier as the CMU mascot.
The text does not contain information about the mascot's graphic design, therefore I cannot answer the question.

The CMU commencement ceremony is scheduled for Sunday, May 12, 2024. The main ceremony will begin at 10:00 AM and will last approximately 1.5 hours.
The text states that CMU's School of Computer Science graduate programs are ranked with the best in the world by a leading U.S. magazine, and its undergraduate programs are also rated the best in the U.S. by corporate recruiters. Therefore, I can answer the question with "The School of Computer Science at CMU is ranked with the best in the world."
The minimum QPA requirement for MIIS students is at least 3.0 in courses and projects used to satisfy degree requirements.
The Kiltie Band began in 1908 with a group of just seven students dedicated to supporting Carnegie Tech football.
