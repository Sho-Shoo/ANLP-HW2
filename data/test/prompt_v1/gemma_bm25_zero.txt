The abstract of Professor Eric P. Xing's paper on "StyleRF: Zero-Shot 3D Style Transfer of Neural Radiance Fields" is as follows:  StyleRF is an innovative 3D style transfer technique that resolves the three-way dilemma over accurate geometry reconstruction, high-quality stylization, and being generalizable to arbitrary new styles. It achieves superior 3D stylization quality with precise geometry reconstruction and can generalize to various new styles in a zero-shot manner.
